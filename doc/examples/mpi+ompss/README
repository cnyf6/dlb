======

This is a small example of an MPI+OmpSs application running optionally with DLB.

Compilation
-----------
The Makefile is ready for OpenMPI. Should you want to use another MPI implementation
modify it accordingly. It also assumes you have Mercurium drivers in your PATH.

Execution
---------
Ideally, executing 'run.sh' script should be enough. Though, depending on your MPI
implementation, you may need to add or modify some specific mpirun flags for either
set the LD_PRELOAD variable or to correctly set the binding for all processes. Note
that DLB will fail if some process share CPU ownership with another one.

You can change the values of DLB and TRACE variablesto modify the script behaviour.
